# Streamer’s Edge

Streamer’s Edge is a love letter to chaotic chat. It’s a full pipeline that
turns raw livestream messages into sentiment, highlights, and fun stats, then
serves it all up in a slick dashboard.

## Where this could go

Beyond analytics for curiosity and entertainment, Streamer’s Edge is designed
with commercialization in mind.

A natural extension is connecting **stream events** (subs, raids, donations,
game moments, announcements) to **conversion-oriented outcomes**, such as:

- spikes in chat activity or sentiment
- follower growth after specific on-stream actions
- timing effects (when announcements or call-to-actions perform best)
- behavioral differences between organic hype vs. prompted engagement

Rather than treating chat as unstructured noise, the goal is to model it as a
reaction signal — one that can be aligned with stream features to answer
questions like:

- *Which moments actually drive engagement or retention?*
- *Do certain streamer behaviors reliably precede growth?*
- *How does chat sentiment evolve before and after key events?*

This opens the door to tooling that helps creators **experiment intentionally**:
measuring what works, what doesn’t, and why — without turning the stream into a
marketing dashboard.

Commercialization would focus on opt-in creator tools, deeper analytics, and
growth insights, while keeping the core experience playful and transparent.
